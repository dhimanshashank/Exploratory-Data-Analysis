# Exploratory Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the Basic Exploratory Data Analysis repository! This repository contains a collection of data exploration projects that I have undertaken. Each directory corresponds to a specific exploration project and includes relevant CSV files and Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb).

Feel free to explore each project to gain insights into different datasets and the exploratory analysis techniques applied. I will be regularly adding new projects to this repository, so stay tuned for more exciting explorations!
